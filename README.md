# Essential Project With React
This repo contains the react applications I implemented in the react course I took from <a href='https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/' target='blank'>Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller</a> Each app has its own readme file. This readme file contains gifs of the apps in action, you can check the app's readme file for details.
